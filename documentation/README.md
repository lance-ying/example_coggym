# Documentation Overview

## Purpose
- Central reference for the schemas and guidelines used throughout this repository.
- HTML files render best in a browser, but key takeaways are summarized here for quick navigation.

## Files
- ``overview.html``: high-level description of the experiment dataset, file relationships, and workflow.
- ``config_schema.html``: specification for ``config.json`` including metadata fields and `experimentFlow`.
- ``trial_schema.html``: schema for trial definitions found in ``stimuli.jsonl`` files.
- ``instruction_schema.html``: structure and formatting rules for participant instruction content.
- ``human_data_schema.html``: layout for raw and aggregated human response data exports.

## How to Use
- Open any HTML file directly in a browser or Markdown viewer with HTML support.
- Cross-reference schema definitions with the corresponding JSON/JSONL files in experiment folders.
- When updating datasets, ensure schema changes are reflected in both the documentation and sample assets.
