        <br><br>
        The player controls a character <icon>assets/icon/human.png</icon>,
        and their goal is collect one of the four gems
        (triangle <icon>assets/icon/gem_triangle.png</icon>,
         square <icon>assets/icon/gem_square.png</icon>,
         hexagon <icon>assets/icon/gem_hexagon.png</icon>, or 
         circle <icon>assets/icon/gem_circle.png</icon>).
        <br><br>
        The rules of the game are as follows:
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li> The player can move on the white squares.</li>
        <li> The player has a full view of the map at all time.</li>
        <li> The player's goal is to collect <strong>exactly one</strong> target gem.</li>
        <li> Keys unlock doors of the same color
          (e.g. red keys <icon>assets/icon/key_red.png</icon> 
           unlock red doors <icon>assets/icon/door_red.png</icon>).
        </li>
        <li> Each key can only be used <strong>once</strong>. Keys disappear after use.</li>
        <li> Each box <icon>assets/icons/box.png</icon> may be empty <icon>assets/icons/box_empty.png</icon>
            or contain exactly one key <icon>assets/icon/box_with_key.png</icon>.
        </li>
        <li> The player <strong>may or may not know</strong> what's in each box.</li>
        <li> Neither you nor the player can see what's hidden in each box. But both of you can see all other objects in the scene.</li>
        <li> There are at most <strong>two keys</strong> hidden among the boxes.</li>
        <li> The player knows that the puzzle is solvable, which means there are just enough keys to reach any of the target gems.
        </ul>
        Your task is to figure out what the player's <strong>goal</strong> is,
        and also what the player <strong>believes</strong> about the contents of the boxes.<br>
